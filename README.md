## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/joyjitroy/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_Artificial_Neural_Networks.ipynb)

**Objective:** Build a neural network-based classifier to predict whether a bank customer will leave within the next 6 months.

**Problem Context:** Banks providing services need to address the problem of "Customer Churn" — customers leaving and joining competing service providers. Understanding which aspects of service influence a customer's decision is critical for business improvement.

**Dataset Features:**
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Geography)
- Account information (Balance, NumOfProducts, Tenure)
- Credit information (CreditScore, HasCrCard)
- Activity status (IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary)
- Target: Exited (0 = Stayed, 1 = Left)

**Techniques Used:**
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Neural network architecture design with TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Handling imbalanced datasets

### 2. Plant Seedling Classification using CNN

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/joyjitroy/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Plant_Seeding_Classification_using_CNN.ipynb)

**Objective:** Build a Convolutional Neural Network to classify plant seedlings into their respective categories.

**Problem Context:** Agriculture is in urgent need of modernization. The ability to automatically identify plant seedlings using AI and Deep Learning can significantly reduce manual labor, improve crop yields, and enable more sustainable agricultural practices.

**Dataset:**
- Images of unique plants belonging to **12 different species**
- Dataset provided by Aarhus University Signal Processing group in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark

**Plant Species:**
- Black-grass, Charlock, Cleavers, Common Chickweed
- Common Wheat, Fat Hen, Loose Silky-bent, Maize
- Scentless Mayweed, Shepherds Purse, Small-flowered Cranesbill, Sugar beet

**Techniques Used:**
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN architecture design
- Transfer learning techniques
- Model evaluation and visualization

### 3. NLP Stock Sentiment Analysis

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/joyjitroy/Machine_Learning/blob/main/NLP_Stock_Sentiment_Analysis/NLP_Stock_Sentiment_Analysis_Full_Code.ipynb)

**Objective:** Build an AI-driven sentiment analysis system to process and analyze financial news articles and gauge market sentiment.

**Problem Context:** Investment firms need sophisticated tools to analyze market sentiment from the vast volume of news and opinions. This project develops a reproducible NLP-based pipeline for classifying financial news sentiment and aggregating weekly sentiment trends.

**Embedding Approaches Evaluated:**
- **Word2Vec** (trained locally, 300-dimensional)
- **GloVe** (pretrained, 100-dimensional)
- **SentenceTransformer-based sentence embeddings** (384-dimensional)

**Key Features:**
- End-to-end NLP pipeline for financial sentiment
- Gradient Boosting classifier with hyperparameter tuning
- Temporal aggregation into weekly sentiment indicators
- LLM-generated weekly financial summaries using Mistral-7B-Instruct

**Model Performance (Tuned GloVe model):**
- Accuracy: 0.714
- Precision: 0.758
- Recall: 0.714
- F1 Score: 0.694

**Resources:**
- Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17510735
